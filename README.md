# Week-1-Challenge
This is the Challenge for Week 1 of the Bootcamp. Due date is the 13th December at 23:59. This was a feature request challenge
whereby I was tasked with making the application .html and .css documents more accessible. I also corrected some minor inaccuracies in the 
code to better reflect the guide image. The html code also had some defunct code which required attention to make the navigation links functional. Comments are shown where appropriate in the .html and .css documents to show the applied changes. Through this assignment, I wanted to develop a better appreciation of what makes code more accessible, develop my understanding of semantic tags and just gain some further experience with the basics -vscode, git commands, bash terminal etc.
